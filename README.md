# Compute Stats

Given a generator that produces data in a csv format, this will compute various statistics for the data. The file should be named 'generator' and placed in the same directory as these files. Running "./compute_stats.rb" runs the generator with a default value of 1000 records. Run "./compute_stats.rb n" to generate n records. You are limited to a maximum of 1 million.
